🧠 Mathematical Functions Hierarchy
A structured, extensible classification of mathematical functions — from polynomials and exponentials to special functions and logic-based systems.
📚 Perfect for:
⦁	📈 Math educators and students
⦁	🧮 Symbolic math engines and compilers
⦁	🧑‍💻 Developers building CAS or scientific tools
⦁	🔍 Researchers modeling mathematical knowledge
📁 What's Inside:
⦁	✅ A complete YAML hierarchy of mathematical functions
⦁	🔄 JSON and SQL-ready formats for APIs and databases
⦁	🧭 Visual mind map of function categories
⦁	🛠️ Tools to convert and extend the taxonomy
⦁	🔗 Foundation for ontologies and math learning apps
🚀 Why This Repo?
Mathematics is vast — this project helps structure its most common functions by behavior, structure, domain, and use-case, making it ideal for:
⦁	Building a searchable math knowledge graph
⦁	Integrating structured math into edtech platforms
⦁	Powering math-aware search or expression parsers
🧩 Topics Covered
⦁	Elementary, algebraic, and transcendental functions
⦁	Vector-valued and matrix functions
⦁	Even, odd, periodic, and monotonic functions
⦁	Special functions (Γ, ζ, Bessel, etc.)
⦁	Applications in probability, logic, signal processing, and more
